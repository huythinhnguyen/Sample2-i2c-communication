I2C_scanner_API-for-Arduino
===========================

This is an API for Arduino which support I2C communication. Using this library can scan to get the I2C messages get send a message to another device.

If you need a quick way to hack into any I2C-enable device or you need an I2C scanner, this may work for you.

===========================

Hi every one, here is an API which I created to solve all I2C communication problem b/w an Arduino board with another hardware.

I'm gonna start with the problem that I faced in a I2C project. As you know, I2C is communication is a multi-device communication methods between different ICs. Usually the communication method will use the first byte in
